# üå¨Ô∏è AQI Predictor AI/ML

> Empowering Communities with Accurate Air Quality Predictions

## üìå Project Overview

The AQI Predictor AI/ML is a sophisticated machine learning web application designed to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Indian cities. Built using Streamlit and powered by advanced ML models, it provides real-time AQI predictions based on weather and pollutant data. The app supports two modes: Normal (Weather + PM2.5) and Scientific (Weather + Pollutants), catering to both general users and environmental researchers. With an interactive dashboard, users can explore historical data, train models, make predictions, and generate multi-day AQI forecasts.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Accurate AQI Forecasting**: Predict AQI using models like Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression.
- **Dual-Mode Predictions**: Offer simplified (Normal) and detailed (Scientific) prediction modes.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Visualize trends, correlations, and seasonal patterns in air quality data.
- **User Accessibility**: Provide an intuitive interface for all users, from individuals to policymakers.

## üåü Features

### Dual Prediction Modes:
- **Normal Mode**: Uses weather data and predicted PM2.5 for simplified AQI forecasting.
- **Scientific Mode**: Incorporates multiple pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) for detailed predictions.

### Multiple ML Models: 
Supports Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and XGBoost with customizable hyperparameters.

### Interactive Data Exploration:
- Visualize AQI distributions, time-series trends, seasonal patterns, and pollutant correlations.
- Display Indian AQI standards with health implications.

### Additional Features:
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Input weather and pollutant parameters to predict AQI instantly.
- **7-Day Forecasts**: Generate multi-day AQI forecasts with weather and pollutant estimates.
- **Model Export**: Download trained models and forecast data as CSV files.
- **City-Specific Analysis**: Supports multiple Indian cities from the dataset.

üëâ **Deployed App**: [howzmyair.streamlit.app](https://howzmyair.streamlit.app)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib
- **Dataset**: Air Quality Data in India (Kaggle)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud/Heroku
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## üìä How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Loads city-specific air quality data from city_day.csv (Kaggle dataset).
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Generates synthetic weather data (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure) based on monthly averages.
   - Creates time-based features (month, day of week, Indian seasons).
   - Fills missing pollutant and AQI values using median or PM2.5-based estimates.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trains a PM2.5 prediction model (Random Forest) for Normal mode.
   - Trains user-selected models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, XGBoost) for AQI prediction.
   - Applies feature weighting in Scientific mode to emphasize weather factors.

4. **Prediction**:
   - **Normal Mode**: Predicts PM2.5 and uses it with weather data for AQI prediction.
   - **Scientific Mode**: Uses user-input pollutants and weather data, with a penalty for deviation from Normal mode predictions.

5. **Forecasting**: Generates 7-day AQI forecasts using estimated weather and pollutant trends.
6. **Visualization**: Displays AQI trends, feature importance, and correlations via interactive plots.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

## üìà Model Performance

The app evaluates multiple models for AQI prediction. Example performance:

| Model | R¬≤ Score | MAE | RMSE |
|-------|----------|-----|------|
| Random Forest | 0.92 | 15.2 | 20.1 |
| XGBoost | 0.94 | 13.8 | 18.5 |
| Decision Tree | 0.87 | 18.5 | 24.3 |
| Linear Regression | 0.78 | 22.1 | 28.7 |

*Note: Metrics depend on the dataset and hyperparameters. Train models in the app to view actual results.*

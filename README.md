🌬️ AQI Predictor AI/ML
Empowering Communities with Accurate Air Quality Predictions
📌 Project Overview
The AQI Predictor AI/ML is a sophisticated machine learning web application designed to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Indian cities. Built using Streamlit and powered by advanced ML models, it provides real-time AQI predictions based on weather and pollutant data. The app supports two modes: Normal (Weather + PM2.5) and Scientific (Weather + Pollutants), catering to both general users and environmental researchers. With an interactive dashboard, users can explore historical data, train models, make predictions, and generate multi-day AQI forecasts.
🎯 Objectives

Accurate AQI Forecasting: Predict AQI using models like Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression.
Dual-Mode Predictions: Offer simplified (Normal) and detailed (Scientific) prediction modes.
Data-Driven Insights: Visualize trends, correlations, and seasonal patterns in air quality data.
User Accessibility: Provide an intuitive interface for all users, from individuals to policymakers.


🌟 Features

Dual Prediction Modes:
Normal Mode: Uses weather data and predicted PM2.5 for simplified AQI forecasting.
Scientific Mode: Incorporates multiple pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) for detailed predictions.


Multiple ML Models: Supports Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and XGBoost with customizable hyperparameters.
Interactive Data Exploration:
Visualize AQI distributions, time-series trends, seasonal patterns, and pollutant correlations.
Display Indian AQI standards with health implications.


Real-Time Predictions: Input weather and pollutant parameters to predict AQI instantly.
7-Day Forecasts: Generate multi-day AQI forecasts with weather and pollutant estimates.
Model Export: Download trained models and forecast data as CSV files.
City-Specific Analysis: Supports multiple Indian cities from the dataset.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Web Framework: Streamlit
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Persistence: Joblib
Dataset: Air Quality Data in India (Kaggle)
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud/Heroku (assumed, update as needed)
Version Control: Git, GitHub


📊 How It Works

Data Loading: Loads city-specific air quality data from city_day.csv (Kaggle dataset).
Preprocessing: 
Generates synthetic weather data (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure) based on monthly averages.
Creates time-based features (month, day of week, Indian seasons).
Fills missing pollutant and AQI values using median or PM2.5-based estimates.


Model Training:
Trains a PM2.5 prediction model (Random Forest) for Normal mode.
Trains user-selected models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, XGBoost) for AQI prediction.
Applies feature weighting in Scientific mode to emphasize weather factors.


Prediction:
Normal Mode: Predicts PM2.5 and uses it with weather data for AQI prediction.
Scientific Mode: Uses user-input pollutants and weather data, with a penalty for deviation from Normal mode predictions.


Forecasting: Generates 7-day AQI forecasts using estimated weather and pollutant trends.
Visualization: Displays AQI trends, feature importance, and correlations via interactive plots.
